# Customer_Churn_Prediction_using-Decision-tree-Random-Forest-XGBoost
A Machine Learning project for Customer Churn Prediction using Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost. Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy, followed by detailed analysis and deployment for predictive use.

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning algorithms: Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost. The analysis includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Visualization, Data Preprocessing, Model Training, and Evaluation. Among the models, Random Forest performed the best in terms of accuracy and was selected for further analysis.

### Dataset Information
The dataset contains customer information with features such as demographics, account information, and usage patterns. The target variable is 'Churn', which is converted from 'Yes' to 1 and 'No' to 0 for model compatibility.

### Steps Involved
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Visualization

2. Gained insights into data distributions and correlations.

3. Data Preprocessing

4. Converted categorical features to numerical using Label Encoder.

5. Handled class imbalance using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).

### Model Training
Trained three models: Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
Among these, Random Forest had the highest accuracy and was chosen for detailed analysis.

### Model Evaluation
Performed accuracy scoring, classification report, and confusion matrix evaluation.

### Model Saving and Loading
Saved the trained Random Forest model using RandomForestClassifier.

### Implemented a predictive system for testing new data.
